# FastTarot

A **tarot card picker** available as a **responsive web app** and a **cross-platform mobile app** (iOS / Android). Both are built from a shared TypeScript core so card data, translations, and game logic are written once.

Spin an interactive wheel of 78 face-down cards, pick 1–10, and reveal your spread — each card upright or reversed, fully localized in **English, Traditional Chinese, and Japanese**.

---

## Overview

| Layer | Tech |
|---|---|
| **Shared core** (`packages/core`) | TypeScript — card data, i18n resources, pure logic (deck, selection, reveal, rotation), design tokens |
| **Web** (`apps/web`) | React + Vite + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, `react-i18next` |
| **Mobile** (`apps/mobile`) | Expo (SDK 51) + expo-router, React Native Reanimated + Gesture Handler, `react-native-svg`, `expo-localization` + `react-i18next` |
| **Tooling** | npm workspaces, ESLint + Prettier (shared config), Python (asset prep + data generation) |

The wheel, card back (a code-drawn celestial SVG mandala), selection rules, reveal orientation, and translations are consistent across platforms because they draw from the same `@fasttarot/core` package.

See [`docs/`](docs/) for the [architecture overview](docs/architecture.md), [i18n guide](docs/i18n-guide.md), and [design token reference](docs/design-tokens.md).

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js ≥ 18** and **npm ≥ 9** (npm workspaces)
- **Python 3.9+** — only needed to regenerate the card dataset
- **Mobile only:** the [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) app on a phone, or an Android/iOS emulator. iOS builds require macOS + Xcode.

---

## Installation

From the repo root:

```bash
npm install
```

This installs dependencies for every workspace (`packages/core`, `apps/web`, `apps/mobile`) and links the shared core.

---

## Running locally

### Web

```bash
npm run web          # starts Vite dev server (http://localhost:5173)
npm run web:build    # type-check + production build -> apps/web/dist
```

### Mobile

```bash
npm run mobile       # starts the Expo dev server
```

Then press `a` (Android emulator), `i` (iOS simulator, macOS only), or scan the QR code with **Expo Go**. You can also run `npm run mobile -- --web` to preview the RN app in a browser via react-native-web.

---

## Card data & assets

The 78-card dataset (`packages/core/data/tarot-cards.json`) is **generated**, not hand-edited — it is the single source of truth for card identity and localized names.

```bash
npm run gen:cards                           # regenerate the JSON dataset
python apps/mobile/scripts/gen_image_map.py # regenerate the mobile require() map
```

Card artwork lives in `assets/img/clean/` — the 78 cropped images shared by both
apps (web bundles them via `import.meta.glob`; mobile via a static `require()` map).

---

## Environment variables

None. The app has no backend, accounts, or secrets (see *Out of scope* below). No `.env` file is required.

---

## Quality

```bash
npm run typecheck    # tsc across all workspaces
npm run lint         # ESLint
npm run format       # Prettier --write
node --test packages/core/test    # run core logic unit tests (after npm install)
```

---

## Build & deployment

**Web** — a static site. Build produces `apps/web/dist`:

```bash
npm run web:build            # -> apps/web/dist
```

The repo ships ready-to-use config for both major static hosts:

- **Vercel** — `vercel.json` at the root (build command, output dir, and asset caching are pre-set). Import the repo and deploy; no dashboard config needed.
- **Netlify** — `netlify.toml` at the root (same settings). Connect the repo and deploy.

For any other host (GitHub Pages, S3+CloudFront, nginx), just build and serve the
`apps/web/dist` folder as static files.

**Mobile** — via [EAS Build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/):

```bash
cd apps/mobile
npx eas build --platform android   # or ios
```

## Version control / branching

- `main` — stable, releasable
- `develop` — integration branch
- `feature/*` — one branch per feature, merged into `develop` via PR

---

## Out of scope (v1)

User accounts, saved readings, card interpretations/meanings, any backend or database, and push notifications.
